<b>In order to start the car:</b> 

Ensure gross funk is on by resetting stop and twisting the red button. 

Ensure gross funk channel is 9.

Ensure wheels are within 5 degrees of center. You can check this with the ./tester.

Ensure all variables on the second screen of the car are False. 

Ensure you terminate the CAN connection appropriately. 



<b> Computer info </b>

The drive we need is DRIVE 2. It is located on the trolly at the moment. 

The computer starts up with David Croft's driver in order to enable PEAK-CAN over USB, into AI-CAN ComPort

If you want to run the CAN, run zedMain.py with python3, no arguments, follow the instructions.

Running zedMain.py with visual=1 will provide info on what the camera sees, and it will disable the CAN interface with the car.
